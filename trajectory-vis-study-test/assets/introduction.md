# Introduction

Welcome to our visualization study. First of all, thank you for participating. 
This is a questionnaire on our visualization research targeted on t-SNE optimization trajectories.
We will ask you a set of questions based on given visualization(s) and then we will be done. The test will take about 20 minutes.
Please complete all questions without interruption. 
Please use a mouse and do not complete it on a phone.
We recommend doing the test using Chrome.

# Informed Consent:
1. **Introduction**
   You have been invited to take part in a user study for a master thesis project from Computer Graphics and Visualization (CGV) of TU Delft: Comparing visualizations on t-SNE optimization dynamics.
   Participation in this research project is voluntary: the decision to take part is up to you. Before you decide to participate we would like to ask you to read the following information, so that you know what the research project is about, what we expect from you and how we deal with processing your personal data. Based on this information you can indicate via the consent declaration whether you consent to take part in this research project and the processing of your personal data.
   You may always contact the researcher via y.song-21@student.tudelft.nl, if you have any questions.

2. **Purpose of the research**
   This research project will be managed by Y. Song. The purpose of this research project is to collect answers to a set of questions based on 3 types of visualization options for comparison for us to evaluate our visualization design.

3. **What will taking part in the research project involve?**
   You will be taking part in a research project in which we will gather information by:
   Asking you to fill in questions about different visualizations
   Asking you to provide the amount of confidence in numerical form in answering each of the questions
   Asking you to provide the amount of effort in numerical form in answering each of the questions
   This study will be completely anonymous, and the data obtained from the study will not be traceable to you. For your participation in this research project you will not be compensated.

4. **Potential risks and inconveniences**
   Your participation in this research project does not involve any physical, legal or economic risks. You do not have to answer questions which you do not wish to answer. Your participation is voluntary. This means that you may end your participation at any moment you choose by letting the researcher know this. You do not have to explain why you decided to end your participation in the research project. Ending your participation will have no disadvantageous consequences for you.
   If you decide to end your participation during the research, the data which you already provided up to the moment of withdrawal of your consent will be used in the research. Do you wish to end the research, or do you have any questions and/or complaints? Then please contact the researcher via y.song-21@student.tudelft.nl.

5. **Confidentiality of data**
   The raw and processed research data will be retained for a period of 5 years. Ultimately after expiration of this time period the data will be either deleted or anonymized so that it can no longer be connected to an individual person. The research data will, if necessary (e.g. for a check on scientific integrity) and only in anonymous form be made available to persons outside the research group.
   This research project was assessed and approved on 18-01-2024 by the ethical review committee of Eindhoven University of Technology.

Consent form for participation by an adult
By signing this consent form I acknowledge the following:
